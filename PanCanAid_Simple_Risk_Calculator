This is PanCanAid Simple Risk Calculator

This calculator collects patient information through a series of questions, calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI),
and evaluates the patient's risk for pancreatic cancer based on family history, gene mutations, and other factors.
If certain high-risk criteria are met, the program will advise the patient to seek pancreatic cancer screening.
Otherwise, it shows the patient's risk factors and suggests the patient to control them if possible.

Questions covered include:
- Age
- Height and weight (for BMI calculation)
- Smoking status and exposure to tobacco smoke
- Diabetes diagnosis
- Alcohol consumption 
- History of pancreatitis
- Cystic fibrosis diagnosis          
- Family history of pancreatic cancer
- Gene mutation status


The program uses if-then conditions to ask follow-up questions based on initial answers and evaluates high-risk factors.
I hope it's helpful to anyone who might use it.
